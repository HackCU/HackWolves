Codeventures! is an app that will introduce people to the concepts within programming through an enjoyable game. In this game, the user will design action functions and use those functions to navigate their character through side-scrolling levels.

This is very much a work in progress; please reference the tutorial below or contact us for assistance.

###To Run:
 - Requires pygame libraries; you can get the download information here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
 - Get the code: $git clone https://github.com/HackCU/HackWolves.git
 - From the HackWolves/code directory, run $python main.py

###Tutorial Information:
 - From the main Codeventures! screen, click on the 'Start' button
 - This new screen is the Building Screen; the initial function is a move right function. Click to pick up and click to drop the building blocks so the top two lines look like this:
	[if   ][rArrow   ][blank]
	[blank][MoveRight][blank]
 - Hit 'Start' again; you can use the function you built to move right with the right arrow key!
 - Uh oh, you can't move right anymore. You did just pick up a block, though. Try going back to the Building Screen.
 - Now you have a MoveLeft block! Try using the blocks to build a function for moving left just below your move right function

The HackWolves teams thanks you for playing! We hope you enjoyed it!
